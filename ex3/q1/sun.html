    <h1>This is the Sun</h1>
    <p>The Sun is the largest object in our Solar System and serves as the primary source of energy for life on Earth. It is classified as a G-type main-sequence star, commonly referred to as a yellow dwarf, and it constantly emits energy that sustains the planets in its orbit.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Sun accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.</li>
        <li>Its core reaches temperatures of approximately 15 million degrees Celsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit).</li>
        <li>The Sun completes a rotation on its axis every 25-35 days, depending on the latitude.</li>
        <li>It produces solar wind, a stream of charged particles that influence space weather.</li>
        <li>The Sun has an expected total lifespan of around 10 billion years and is currently in its middle age.</li>
        <li>The energy emitted by the Sun drives the Earth's climate and weather systems.</li>
        <li>Solar eclipses occur when the Moon passes directly between the Sun and Earth, temporarily blocking its light.</li>
